Check out the slides of the talk:
http://www.slideshare.net/antonkeks/choose-a-pattern-for-a-problem

The code is written mostly in a TDD way, so look at the tests 
for examples of how the code works!

Each pattern has a dedicated Java package in both src/ and test/
directories that solves the problem described on the slides.

Enjoy!
